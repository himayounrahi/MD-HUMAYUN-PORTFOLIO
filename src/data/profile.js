  // One sentence. This is the single most-read line on the site.
  pitch:
    'I build machine learning systems that survive contact with real infrastructure — an inline intrusion prevention engine evaluated on 2.5 million flows, a multi-agent drone swarm simulator, an SDN detector measured under live attack traffic.',

  // Two or three short paragraphs for the About section.
  bio: [
    "I'm an M.Tech student in Computer Science at SVNIT Surat, specialising in Information Security and Privacy, with a GATE CS percentile of 93.8. My work sits where machine learning meets systems engineering: models are the easy half, and the interesting problems live in the pipeline around them.",
    'My M.Tech dissertation, IPS-ML, is an intrusion prevention system built on the premise that an inline device executes its own predictions: a false positive there does not raise an alert, it drops a legitimate connection. So it is evaluated as a control system rather than a classifier, with recall and false alarm rate as the headline metrics and SHAP explanations written into the enforcement path.',
    'Alongside that I was a research intern on a MeitY-sponsored project on autonomous drone swarm navigation, where I built BattleWorld — a multi-agent simulator wrapped as a Gymnasium environment — and benchmarked seven commander architectures against it. The resulting paper is under review at IEEE GSCON 2027.',
    'Before those I built an SDN intrusion detector I could measure under load, reproduced the original Variational Autoencoder paper and diagnosed why it collapsed on face data, and shipped a retrieval-augmented medical assistant running entirely on local inference.',
